# Using the Vision API with Python

Learn how to use various features found in the Google Cloud Vision API with Python.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account (G Suite accounts may require administrator approval)
- A Google Cloud Platform project
- An active GCP billing account
- A modern web browser such Chrome or Firefox
- Familiarity with standard Linux text editors such as Vim, Emacs or Nano
- Basic Python skills; this exercise requires Python 3.6+. (It is possible to backport the code to 2.x provided you have the requisite libraries, however we recommend moving to 3.x as soon as possible.)

## Description

The [https://cloud.google.com/vision](Google Cloud Vision API) allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, facial features detection, landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), "safe search", or tagging of explicit content, detecting product or corporate logos, and several others.

This repository consists of the sample apps that are part of the [http://g.co/codelabs/vision-python]("Using the Vision API with Python" hands-on codelab). That codelab teaches developers how to use some of the features described above with the Cloud Vision API using Python, namely label annotations, OCR/text extraction, landmark detection, and detecting facial features!
